# Frequent Patter Mining README

## Introduction:
- Data science project on association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm.
- Objective: Reveal meaningful patterns and associations in a transaction dataset.

## Dataset:
- List of transactions, each a unique combination of items.
- `Milk` - `Onion` - `Nutmeg` - `Kidney Beans` - `Eggs` - `Yogurt` - `Dill` - `Apple` - `Unicorn` - `Corn` - `Ice cream`


## Approach:
- Apriori algorithm employed for discovering frequent itemsets and association rules.
- Algorithm establishes connections between frequently co-occurring items.

## Data Preparation:
- Transaction list transformed using mlxtend's TransactionEncoder.
- Binary matrix created, denoting presence or absence of items in transactions.

## Insights from Apriori Algorithm:
- Minimum support threshold: 60%
- Revealed frequent itemsets, combinations, and association rules.
