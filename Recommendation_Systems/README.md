# Recommendation_Systems README

## Objective:
- Implement and evaluate recommendation systems using the surprise library in Python.

## Dataset:
- Utilize both a built-in MovieLens-100k dataset and a custom book recommendation dataset from Kaggle.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- KNNBaseline algorithm for item-item similarity in both movie and book recommendation scenarios.
- Use of NormalPredictor, ALS, SGD, and SVD algorithms for comparison.

## Tasks and Demonstrations:
- Load and explore the MovieLens-100k dataset, including data cleaning and understanding.
- Apply the KNNBaseline algorithm for item-item similarity and recommend movies.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm using cross-validation.
- Extend the project to a custom book recommendation dataset and use the surprise library.
- Identify and recommend books using the KNNBaseline algorithm for the custom dataset.
- Implement cross-validation and grid search for algorithm comparison and parameter tuning.
