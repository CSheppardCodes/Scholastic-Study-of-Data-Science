# KMeans Clustering README
# Applying KMeans Clustering on Synthetic and Real Datasets

## Synthetic Dataset Generation
- Use NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn libraries.
- Generate 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional synthetic datasets.
- Visualize the structures of synthetic datasets.

## Clustering Using K-means
- Apply K-means clustering to the 2-dimensional dataset.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualize actual vs. clustered data with predicted cluster centers.

## Evaluation Criteria: WCSS and Silhouette Score
- Compute Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares (WCSS) and Silhouette Score.
- Assess the cohesion within clusters and separation between them.

## Finding Best Hyperparameters
- Automatically test various values of the hyperparameter k.
- Visualize evaluation criteria to identify the best number of clusters.

## Working with the California Housing Dataset
- Download and explore the California housing dataset.
- Visualize the geographical distribution using latitude and longitude.

## K-means Clustering on Housing Dataset
- Apply K-means clustering to the housing dataset.
- Visualize resulting clusters to identify distinct geographical patterns.

## Finding Best Value of K for Housing Dataset
- Explore different values of k to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Select a suitable number of clusters capturing meaningful patterns in the data.

## Working with US Arrests Data and Pipelines
- Analyze the US Arrests dataset and introduce machine learning pipelines.
- Create a pipeline for scaling and clustering to enhance data processing efficiency.

## Creating a Pipeline
- Establish a machine learning pipeline for scaling and applying K-means clustering.
- Streamline the workflow for efficient data processing.

## Clustering Results and Analysis
- Investigate clustering results and sort states based on clusters.
- Gain insights into crime profiles of different states.

## Choosing a State to Live
- Identify states with different crime profiles from a reference state (Texas).
- Explore states with the lowest crime profiles for informed residential decisions.
