# Text Classification with Transfer Learning

This concise tutorial guides you through text classification using transfer learning with TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading:** Use the balanced IMDB dataset (25,000 reviews each for training and testing).

2. **Model Building:** Create a neural network with a pre-trained text embedding (Google's NNLM) and dense layers.

3. **Text Representation:** Leverage transfer learning for text embeddings, simplifying preprocessing and ensuring fixed-size outputs.

4. **Model Structure:** Stack layers with a TensorFlow Hub layer, a dense layer (16 hidden units), and a final output layer.

5. **Training:** Train for 10 epochs, monitor with validation data, and use binary crossentropy loss.

6. **Evaluation:** Achieve around 87% accuracy on the test dataset.

## Results and Insights

- Transfer learning simplifies text representation and provides a fixed-size output.
- Model architecture decisions impact performance (e.g., number of layers, hidden units).
- Binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer are effective for this binary classification task.

## Next Steps

Explore advanced techniques for improved accuracy, aiming for a target of 95%. For more details, refer to the [MLCC Text Classification Guide](#) and other TFHub text-related tutorials.
